Hand Gesture Recognition using Machine Learning
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a Hand Gesture Recognition system using Machine Learning (SVM classifier) and OpenCV. The model is trained on the LeapGestRecog dataset to classify different hand gestures from images.
ðŸš€ Features
Preprocesses images (grayscale + resize to 64Ã—64)
Flattens images into feature vectors
Trains an SVM classifier on gesture images
Achieves high accuracy on test data
Supports testing with your own image
ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Python 3
OpenCV (cv2)
scikit-learn
NumPy
ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The project uses the LeapGestRecog dataset containing gesture images. Download and extract it before running the code.
â–¶ UsageTrain & Evaluate Model
Run the program:
python program.py

Test with Your Own Image
Place your image (e.g., my_hand.jpg) in the project folder and update:

test_img = cv2.imread("my_hand.jpg", cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

ðŸ“Š Results

Model accuracy: 1.0 (100%) on the dataset

Successfully predicts gestures like palm, fist, thumbs up, etc.

ðŸ”® Future Work

Implement real-time gesture recognition using webcam

Try with deep learning (CNNs) for better accuracy
